# Stopwatch-by-Pratham.sy
Stopwatch is a simple web application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to measure elapsed time with precision by providing start, stop, and reset functionality. The stopwatch displays time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, with numbers rolling from top to bottom to increase and bottom to top to decrease.
